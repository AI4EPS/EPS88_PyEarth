Introduction & Python 101 (09/09):
For this introductory class, you might want to start with a simple dataset. Here are some options:

"Earth Surface Temperature Data": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
"World Happiness Report": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness


Numpy & Pandas (09/16):
These libraries are great for data manipulation and analysis. Consider:

"Global Land Temperatures by City": https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

Project (12/02 & 12/09):
For the project, students might want to choose from any of the above datasets or explore other earth science-related datasets on Kaggle based on their specific interests.

Remember to verify the licenses and usage terms for each dataset before incorporating them into your coursework. Also, encourage students to explore Kaggle's Earth Science category for more options: https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=tag%3A%22earth+science%22
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these datasets or suggest alternatives for specific topics?
