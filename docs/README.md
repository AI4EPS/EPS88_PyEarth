Welcome to EPS88 PyEarth: A Python Introduction to Earth Science

<!-- [![documentation](https://github.com/ai4eps/EPS207_Observational_Seismology/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://ai4eps.github.io/EPS207_Observational_Seismology/) -->

Earthquakes and El Ninos are examples of natural hazards in California.  The course uses Python/Jupyter Notebook and real-world observations to introduce students to these and other Earth phenomena and their underlying physics.  The students will learn how to access and visualize the data, extract signals, and make probability forecasts.   The final module is a project that synthesizes the course material to make a probabilistic forecast.  The course will be co-taught by a team of EPS faculty, and the focus of each semester will depend on the expertise of the faculty in charge.

The class will be a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises. We will use primarily Python (obpsy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pytorch, etc.) as programming languages. The course is designed for undergraduate students. No prior knowledge of Earth Science is required.
