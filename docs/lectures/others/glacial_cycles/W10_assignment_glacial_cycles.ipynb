    "\n",
    "Your assignment is conduct spectral analysis on different portions of the Lisecki and Raymo (2005) benthic oxygen isotope data to determine the period of glacial-interglacial cycles. Choose at least 4 different intervals to look at with each analyzed interval being >500,000 years. A good place to start will be to look at data from the 800,000 years and compare it to data from the 800,000 to 1,600,000 year (remember 1000 years ago is 1 ka).\n",
