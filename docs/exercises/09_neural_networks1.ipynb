    "## 1.1. A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1940s, NNs were conceived.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1960s, the concept of backpropagation came, then people know how to train them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2010, NNs started winning competitions and get much attention than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2010, NNs have been on a meteoric rise as their magical ability to solve problems previously deemed unsolvable (i.e., image captioning, language translation, audio and video synthesis, and more).\n",
    "\n",
    "One important milestone is the AlexNet architecture in 2012, which won the ImageNet competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/alexnet.png) -->\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/alexnet.png' style='width: 30%'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/alexnet_score.png) -->\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/alexnet_score.png' style='width: 30%'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ImageNet competition is a benchmark for image classification, where the goal is to classify images into one of 1,000 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/imagenet.png) -->\n",
    "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/imagenet.png' style='width: 30%'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about the AlexNet model on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet). We will use the AlexNet model in the next lecture to classify images of rocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, NNs are the primary solution to most competitions and technological challenges like self-driving cars, calculating risk, detecting fraud, early cancer detection,…\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. What is a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs are inspired by the organic brain, translated to the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANNs have neurons, activations, and interconnectivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "NNs are considered “black boxes” between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuwq0/images/main/1-8-basic-nn.png' style='width: 60%'/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection between neurons has a weight associated with it. Weights are multiplied by corresponding input values. These multiplications flow into the neuron and are summed before being added with a bias. Weights and biases are trainable or tunable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "output & = weight \\cdot input + bias \\\\\n",
    "y & = a \\cdot x + b\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula should look very familiar to you. It is similar to the previous linear regression and classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, an activation function is applied to the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "output & = \\sum (weight \\cdot input) + bias \\\\\n",
    "output & = activation (output)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When a step function that mimics a neuron in the brain (i.e., “firing” or not, on-off switch) is used as an activation function:\n",
    "- If its output is greater than 0, the neuron fires (it would output 1).\n",
    "- If its output is less than 0, the neuron does not fire and would pass along a 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input layer represents the actual input data (i.e., pixel values from an image, temperature, …)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data can be “raw”, should be preprocessed like normalization and scaling. \n",
    "- The input needs to be in numeric form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer is whatever the NN returns.\n",
    "- In regression, the predicted value is a scalar value, the output layer has a single neuron.\n",
    "- In classification, the class of the input is predicted, the output layer has as many neurons as the training dataset has classes. But can also have a single output neuron for binary (two classes) classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical NN has thousands or even up to millions of adjustable parameters (weights and biases).\n",
    "\n",
    "NNs act as enormous functions with vast numbers of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the combination of parameter (weight and bias) values is the challenging part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end goal for NNs is to adjust their weights and biases (the parameters), so they produce the desired output for unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major issue in supervised learning is overfitting, where the algorithm doesn’t understand underlying input-output dependencies, just basically “memorizes” the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of NN is generalization, that can be obtained when separating the data into training data and validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weights and biases are adjusted based on the error/loss presenting how “wrong” the algorithm in NN predicting the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "NNs can be used for regression (predict a scalar, singular, value), clustering (assigned unstructured data into groups), and many other tasks.\n"
