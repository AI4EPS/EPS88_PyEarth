    "This Jupyter Notebook is your playground for practicing Python exercises in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to experiment, test your code, and learn by doing\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips to get you started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code Cells: Each cell in this notebook is a code cell. You can write and execute Python code in these cells\n",
    "2. Execution: To execute a code cell, you can press Shift + Enter or click the Run button in the toolbar above\n",
    "3. Order of Execution: Cells are executed in the order they appear in the notebook. Make sure to run cells sequentially to avoid errors\n",
    "4. Variables and Functions: You can define variables and functions in one cell and use them in other cells\n",
    "5. Documentation: Use comments (#) to add explanations and instructions to your code. This will help you and others understand your code\n",
    "6. Experiment: Don't be afraid to try different things and experiment with the code. That's how you learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get started with some Python exercises. Have fun exploring and learning\n",
    "Happy coding!"
